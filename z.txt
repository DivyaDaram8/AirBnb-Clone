Storing passwords
    -we never store passwords as it is, we store their hashed form.
Hashing
    - one way function, we can't get input from output
    -for a diff input there is a diff output but of same length
    -small changes in input should bring large changes in output
    - for ex: modulo operator i.e. 3%3 is 0, and 6%3 is also zero same output but inp can't be predicted it can be 3,6,9,12 ...
Salting
    -technique is used to protect paswords stored in databases by adding a string of 32 or more characters and then hashing them.
    - if password is abc, salt is "%?@" the salted form is abc%?@ and then hashing can be done.
    - reverse table of lookup : which contains hashed forms and input of hash output.
